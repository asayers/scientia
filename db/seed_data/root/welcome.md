Welcome to Scientia, a place for typesetting and publishing documents. Documents are written in markdown, a simple markup language which lets you easily include rich formatting. For instance:

# This is a heading

## And this is a subheading

This is an ordinary paragraph. You can have text in *italics* and **boldface**, as well as footnotes[^1] and citations[@jones99]. You can use en-dashes ("pp. 39--43") and em-dashes---like so---and "quotes are handled 'intelligently'". You can even write equations in latex notation: $$\frac{1}{2\pi}$$. There are many more features, such as tables:

| Fruit         | Price         |
|---------------|---------------|
| Bananas       | £1.34         |
| Oranges       | £2.10         |

Documents are typeset using latex; at the moment there is no way to include raw latex in your document, but we're working on this. For the original Markdown manual, see [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax); for a complete listing of the Markdown extensions Scientia supports, see [here](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown).

Have fun using Scientia!

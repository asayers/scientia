title:  Textore Change Log
author: Alex Sayers

Technologies
============

 - Pandoc for markdown -> tex
 - pdflatex (with some wrapper?) for tex -> pdf
 - moustache for templating

To Do
=====

- Figure out why Essay template produces a blank page
- Use js on doc#show to query for pdf readiness (a couple of times a second?)
- Don't write so many temporary files :S
- Make doc.regenerate a sidekiq worker, so it can be called synchronously (by doc#update) or async (by tem/bib#update)
- Prevent username updating
- Rewrite template system, using handlebars
- Add bib file to folder during render
- Get metadata rendering in HTML view
- Ensure all html is escaped! Look into XSS.
- Find out where html bullets went (css? normalise?)
- Add private boolean field to Document
- Add timer to flash notices (fade out)
- Retrieve more informative error messages
- Add url-change warning (javascript) to #edit
- In user#show, use html for document previews (span-level only)
- Tighten up SQL queries
- Make document edit field use a monospace font
- Syntax highlighting! (md and latex)
- Lock down sign-ups
- Add icons to description grid (placeholder/font-awesome)
- Add grid-lines to description grid?


Under Consideration
-------------------

- Isolate MathJax to document#show?
- Replace compass with bourbon?
- Change name? (Sapientum?)
- Move metadata out of body?
- Move document preview into iframe?
- Separate stylesheet for doc preview?
- Button to generate bibtex snipped for document.
- Autogenerate full textore bibliography.
- Sandbox pdflatex/pandoc
- Change rtex for rubbr?
- Add description column to template? (and document?)

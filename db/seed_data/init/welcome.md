Welcome to Scientia, a place for typesetting and publishing documents. Documents are written in markdown, a simple markup language which lets you easily include rich formatting. For instance:

# This is a heading

## And this is a subheading

This is an ordinary paragraph. You can have text in *italics* and **boldface**, as well as footnotes^[like this] and citations[@jones99]. You can use en-dashes ("pp. 39--43") and em-dashes---like so---and "quotes are handled 'intelligently'". You can even write equations in latex notation: $\frac{1}{2\pi}$. There are many more features, such as tables:

+---------------+---------------+
| Fruit         | Price         |
+===============+===============+
| Bananas       | £1.34         |
+---------------+---------------+
| Oranges       | £2.10         |
+---------------+---------------+

Documents are typeset using latex, and any latex you include in your document will be passed through unmolested (the equation above is an example of this). For the original Markdown manual, see [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax); for a complete listing of the Markdown extensions Scientia supports, see [here](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown).

Have fun using Scientia!
